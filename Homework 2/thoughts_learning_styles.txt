I thought that the articleâ€™s discussion about learning styles was interesting and actually felt pretty accurate. I have noticed that while I tend to like more of the visual-interactive style for learning, it is not always the easiest way for me to learn the information.  Often a written section that explains the information, followed by an exercise where I make use of the information is actually the most effective.  I do think there is a preference for general learning styles, so some people have an easier time learning in certain ways, but I agree with the article that focusing only on the preferred style is not going to help, but that using a mix is probably going to be better for retention and learning.  To a certain extent, spacing out the learning can be useful, but that really depends on the topic.  More complex topics are likely better spread out over time, but simpler material risks becoming boring and people losing interest, which can detract from actual remembrance. That could also result from not actually properly doing the repetitive review because of lack of interest and lack of meaningful use.
