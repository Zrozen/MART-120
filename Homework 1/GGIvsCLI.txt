Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

GUI is a method of interacting with computers primarily using visual displays.
CLI is a method of interacting primarily using text-based commands and not pictures.
The GUI is generally easier to use and more user friendly because the user does not
need to know the exact commands, only which selections to make.
The CLI lets you do more things, but you need to know what to tell it to do to get
there, which makes it harder to use because of the extra precision required.
